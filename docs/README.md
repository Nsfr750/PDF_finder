## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Optional backends for PDF rendering (Auto falls back safely):
  - PyMuPDF (fitz) — default and bundled via requirements
  - Ghostscript (for Wand) — install Ghostscript and set its executable path in Settings

See [PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md) for platform-specific setup.

### Install from source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nsfr750/PDF_finder.git
   cd PDF_finder
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Click "Scan Folder" to select a directory to scan for duplicate PDFs.

3. Review the results in the main window. After a scan completes, the file list is automatically populated with the scanned PDFs and duplicate groups.

4. Use the tools to manage duplicates:
   - Mark files to keep
   - Delete unwanted duplicates
   - Preview files before taking action

## Key Features in Detail

### Smart PDF Comparison

The application uses advanced text extraction and comparison algorithms to identify duplicate PDFs based on their content rather than just metadata. This means it can find duplicates even if:

- Files have different names
- Files have different creation/modification dates
- Files have slightly different visual formatting but identical text content

### Multi-language Support

Version 3.0.0 introduces comprehensive multi-language support with:

- **12 Supported Languages**: English, Italian, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese
- **Instant Language Switching**: Change languages without restarting the application
- **Professional Translations**: High-quality translations by native speakers
- **Automatic Detection**: Detects system language and defaults to it when available

### Enhanced User Interface

The completely redesigned interface offers:

- **Dual-View Layout**: Separate tabs for file list and duplicate groups
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by size, date, name patterns, and similarity thresholds
- **Context Menus**: Right-click actions for quick file operations
- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time feedback during scanning and processing
- **Theme Support**: Light and dark themes with system integration

### Performance Optimizations

Significant performance improvements in version 3.0.0:

- **Faster Scanning**: Optimized algorithms for quicker duplicate detection
- **Memory Efficiency**: Better memory management for large PDF collections
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching to speed up repeated operations
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking operations for better responsiveness
